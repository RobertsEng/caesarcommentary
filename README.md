### Commentarii de Bello Gallico

Here I examined the McDevitte translation of Julius Caesar's ['Commentarii de Bello Gallico'](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657) for the names of settlements, attempted to ascertain their geospatial coordinates, and overlaid their positions onto a modern map of Europe. Dissatisfied with the performance of available geoparsers on this historical document, I examined the document in its entirety manually (excluding only the additional commentary by Aulus Hirtius), using online references where needed to determine settlement location.

For the most part, I confined the inclusion of individual settlements to those which were explicitly named. 
Exceptions include settlements that were not named but were nonetheless of substantive importance to the events 
described, as is the case with the oppidum of the Aduatuci. 

I did not include demonyms as instances of a settlement name. For example,
the Tolosates (of Tolosa/Toulouse) are mentioned by Caesar, but I did not count the use of 'Tolosates' 
as an instance of 'Tolosa.' Rather, 'Tolosa' was only counted when mentioned explicitly.

I included some settlements for which the locations are approximate and not of high certainty. For example, 
the settlement of Noreia is considered lost, and the coordinates provided by Pleiades appear to
be only approximate and based on the Tabula Peutingeriana (which, tangentially, contains two adjacent
entries for Noreia, possibly a medieval copying error). I have noted cases such as this that are matters of
debate and speculation as 'disputed,' while others that simply appear to have low quality evidence are 
simply noted as having a 'low' confidence. Settlements and fortifications for which there appears to be
extremely little to no supporting circumstantial or achaeological evidence were not included, as was the case
with the supposed identification of Devil's Dyke in Hertfordshire as the site fortification where Caesar
defeated Cassivellaunus.

There appeared to be some confusion in the literature over whether Melodunum and Metiosedum referred to the same
settlement; I deferred to Martin Bladen's view that they are the same, professed in his [notes on Caesar's commentaries](https://books.google.com/books?id=f75yPjN9S48C&pg=PR15&lpg=PR15&dq=Metiosedum&source=bl&ots=yP2aBPDBU_&sig=ACfU3U1ZDRBG9LbYIQo5ZU43zqFv5PmUUg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVz-ynyYPwAhVVHc0KHcW7D8EQ6AEwD3oECAwQAw#v=onepage&q=Metiosedum&f=false).
